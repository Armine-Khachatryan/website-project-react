                    100 x 1 impact, meaning your $10 can abolish up to $1,000 in medical debt.  The only drawback is
                    that a significant number of families have more than one unpaid medical debt, and it could leave
                    them with other medical debt obligations.  This program provides great value, but it is not
                    achieving a complete clean slate that we are striving for.

                    remaining delinquent medical debt can apply for our Application Program to abolish their remaining
                    debt.  Allowing us to merge these two fantastic programs into the best outcome in the least
                    expensive manner possible.
